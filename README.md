# LupaSearch Magento 2 Db Queue Compatibility Extension

## About extension

The primary [LupaSearch Magento 2 extension](https://github.com/lupasearch/magento2-plugin) assumes RabbitMQ is available as the default queuing system. When RabbitMQ is not part of your projectâ€™s infrastructure, the core plugin may not function correctly due to its reliance on AMQP protocols.

This compatibility extension resolves that issue by enabling LupaSearch extension to work seamlessly with MySQL queues.

## Installation

1. Add extension using Composer:

```
composer require lupasearch/magento2-lupasearch-plugin-queue-db
```

2. Run the necessary setup and compilation commands to enable the extension:

```
bin/magento module:enable LupaSearch_LupaSearchPluginQueueDb
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento setup:di:compile
```
